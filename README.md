## Description
The SVG Logo Generator was created to take a step of work out of creating a business. I personally struggle with executing artistically creative ideas. This application only requires the user to provide the ideas for a logo, like its text and color, and does the rest of the work itself.

## Installation
To use this software, clone the repo to your local machine, open the file in a command line, and enter "npm start". You will be prompted through 4 questions, then your logo will be generated as an SVG file named "logo.svg" in the "examples" directory. WARNING: only one logo will be saved at a time, so make a copy of any logos you would like to save!

## Usage
Once "npm start" is run, follow the instructions. The command line will ask for text for the logo (which must be at least 1 character and not more than 3 characters), a color for the text's font, a shape, and a color for the shape. I have posted a YouTube [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/VaozALFJb84) that demonstrates how to use this software.
